# PMSSS Disbursement System

The proposed system will allow students to upload their required documents through a secure online portal. Upon submission, the documents will be automatically sent to the SAG Bureau for verification. Once verified, the SAG Bureau will forward the approved documents to the Finance Bureau for the release of payments. The system will ensure that the entire process, from document submission to scholarship disbursement, is conducted digitally, eliminating the need for any hard copy submissions.
